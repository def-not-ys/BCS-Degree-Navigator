			<h3>CPSC: Computer Science</h3>
		
			<p>The Department of Computer Science offers several options in first year:  CPSC 110 is for students pursuing Computer Science specializations or who plan to take CPSC 210.   CPSC 103 targets students desiring an introduction to computing and programming, but with no plans to take further Computer Science courses.   CPSC 100 targets students desiring a general introduction to computational thinking with little programming.   Consult https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/choose-your-first-course for more information. Students who have credit for or exemption from APSC 160, CPSC 107 or CPSC 110 may not take CPSC 100 or CPSC 103. Students with other computer science transfer credit must consult the department. Students currently registered in CPSC 110 or with Computer Science credit from another institution may not take APSC 160 for credit. Students with sufficient background in the concepts presented in CPSC 110 and an advisor's approval are encouraged to challenge CPSC 110 for credit by taking an examination. Additional fees are charged for some courses. For more information students are advised to contact the Department of Computer Science or visit its undergraduate website: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad). For information on credit exclusion between CPSC and other courses, please consult the Faculty of Science Credit Exclusion List.</p>
