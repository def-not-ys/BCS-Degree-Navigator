<h2>Mathematics, Faculty of Science</h2>
		
			<h3>MATH: Mathematics</h3>
		
			<p>The first digit in the number of a course is intended to convey the level of mathematical maturity at which the course is conducted rather than the year in which it must be taken. Students who expect to follow an Honours Science program or one with high mathematical content are urged to apply for admission to MATH 120 and 121. The following courses are for students in the Faculty of Applied Science: MATH 152, MATH 253, MATH 255, MATH 256, MATH 257, MATH 263, MATH 265, MATH 267. Secondary-school calculus is a prerequisite for MATH 100, 102, and 104. Students with this qualification should see "UBC-SFU-UVIC-UNBC Calculus Examination Certificate" in the Admissions section. MATH 180 and 184 are designed for students without high-school calculus. Continuing Studies offers MATH 001, 002, 003, and 004, refresher courses in pre-calculus material. For further information see the department's website at www.math.ubc.ca.</p>
